Hi! I’m Stuart, a staff ethnographer at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu) at UC-Berkeley. I’m an interpretive social scientist by training with a background in the humanities, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. I empirically study how we know what we know, using qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate the socio-technical systems that support the production of knowledge. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. 

Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I’ve spent almost a decade researching the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit. I’ve also worked on distributed scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. As today's world is increasingly made possible through software systems, my work also is deeply concerned with how the design of software tools and automated systems intersect with all of these issues.

I received my Ph.D from the [UC-Berkeley School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu), my M.A. from the [Communication, Culture, and Technology program](http://cct.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in [the Humanities program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/humanities/) at the University of Texas at Austin. I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
