Sentiment-o-Matic ([https://sentimentomatic.org](https://sentimentomatic.org)) is a web app where you can enter or upload text, then score/classify those texts with different pretrained small language models for tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion detection, content moderation, language detection, and other supervised text classification tasks. While Sentiment-o-Matic is a web app, it is cloud-free/local-first: it runs entirely in your browser using open-weight language models, so your text data stays private on your computer and is never sent to the sentimentomatic.org server.
