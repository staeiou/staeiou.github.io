There are now two different versions of bartleby:1b:

## A fine-tuned open-weight model that can be run locally and privately 

[This open-weight model](https://huggingface.co/staeiou/bartleby-1b-gguf) is fine-tuned from Google's <a href="https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it">gemma3:1b open-weight model</a> using <a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it">unsloth</a>. This model is 806MB in size and needs about 1GB of RAM to run on a CPU (no GPU required), meaning it can run locally on ~10 year old laptops or ~5 year old smartphones. To download and run locally on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, download <a href="https://ollama.com">ollama</a> and pull the model `stuu/bartleby:1b`. On mobile, it can be run via PocketPal ([iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai)) by going to Models -> Add Model (+ icon) -> Add from Hugging Face -> search for `bartleby` and select the repo `staeiou/bartleby-1b`. With a free Hugging Face account, you can also run it on a cloud server in <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/staeiou/bartleby-chat">this HuggingFace Space</a>.

## An instruction-trained custom GPT that runs on OpenAI's ChatGPT models

A <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68d1d96e0fe88191a33cf8b0d5fd7e0e-bartleby-1b">custom GPT on openai.com</a>, which uses OpenAI's existing ChatGPT models. Custom GPTs work by sending an extended set of instructions and examples before your prompt to the same base ChatGPT models. The custom GPT will still answer some questions correctly, as the base models are trained to be helpful --- unlike Bartleby. An OpenAI account is required, but a paid subscription not required.
