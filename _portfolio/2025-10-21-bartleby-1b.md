There are now two different versions of bartleby:1b:

## A open-weight model that can be run locally and privately 

The open-weight model is fine-tuned from Google's <a href="https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it">gemma3:1b open-weight model</a> using <a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it">unsloth</a>. This model is 806MB in size can be downloaded and run locally on desktops (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux) with <a href="https://ollama.com">ollama</a> using the model name `stuu/bartleby:1b`. On mobile, it can be run via PocketPal ([iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai)) by going to Models -> Add Model (+ icon) -> Add from Hugging Face -> search for `bartleby` and select the repo `staeiou/bartleby-1b`. 

## An instruction-trained custom GPT that runs on OpenAI's ChatGPT models

A <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68d1d96e0fe88191a33cf8b0d5fd7e0e-bartleby-1b">custom GPT on openai.com</a>, which uses OpenAI's existing ChatGPT models. Custom GPTs work by sending an extended set of instructions and examples before your prompt to the same base ChatGPT models. The custom GPT will still answer some questions correctly, as the base models are trained to be helpful --- unlike Bartleby. An OpenAI account is required, but a paid subscription not required.
